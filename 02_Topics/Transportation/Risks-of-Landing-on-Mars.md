# Risks of Landing on Mars: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly

## Overview
Landing on Mars is one of the most demanding engineering feats in space exploration. Nearly half of all Mars landing attempts have ended in failure, illustrating the formidable challenges involved. The phrase "seven minutes of terror" was coined to describe the nail-biting entry, descent, and landing (EDL) sequence that a spacecraft endures after a months-long journey to the Red Planet. Despite these risks, successful Mars landings have yielded enormous scientific rewards and paved the way for future human missions. This report examines all aspects of landing on Mars – the good (successful techniques and outcomes), the bad (technical challenges and concerns), and the ugly (past failures and worst-case scenarios) – with a focus on current and upcoming technologies (including Elon Musk’s SpaceX tech stack) as well as both robotic and future human missions.

## Current Understanding
Mars landings, when successful, are triumphs of precision engineering and have greatly advanced our understanding of Mars. Over the decades, space agencies have developed and refined a variety of EDL systems that turned perilous descents into success stories. Notably, NASA has achieved 12 successful robotic landings out of 19 attempts as of the mid-2020s, deploying landers and rovers that have operated for years on the Martian surface. Each success provides valuable data to improve landing techniques for subsequent missions.

### Proven Landing Techniques
Several approaches have been used to land safely on Mars, each with its own strengths. Small missions like **Mars Pathfinder** (1997) and the **Mars Exploration Rovers** (Spirit and Opportunity, 2004) used parachutes to slow down and then **airbag-cushioned bounces** to survive the final drop, an ingeniously simple method for lightweight payloads. Larger missions have required more controlled techniques. NASA's **Viking 1 and 2** landers (1976) and later stationary landers like **Phoenix** (2008) and **InSight** (2018) used a combination of parachutes and **retropropulsive rockets** (i.e. thrusters firing downward against the descent) to decelerate and achieve soft touchdown on legs. The **Sky Crane** system, debuted with **Curiosity** (2012) and used again for **Perseverance** (2021), represents another successful innovation: after parachute descent, a hovering rocket-powered stage lowers the rover on cables for a gentle wheels-down landing, then flies off to crash at a safe distance. This complex system allowed delivery of ~1-ton rovers with high precision and minimal surface impact. The success of Perseverance’s landing in a hazardous terrain in 2021 – billed by NASA as the most difficult Martian landing ever attempted – showcased advanced new EDL capabilities like **Terrain Relative Navigation** (which let the rover autonomously divert away from unsafe ground) and a **range trigger** for optimal parachute timing. These technologies have shrunk landing ellipses (the uncertainty area for touchdown) dramatically, improving the odds of a safe, precise landing near desired science targets.

### Scientific and Technological Payoffs
The “good” outcomes of Mars landings are evident in the wealth of knowledge gained. Successful landers and rovers have discovered signs of past water, active geology, and even carried experiments to produce resources (for example, Perseverance’s MOXIE instrument demonstrated generation of oxygen from the CO₂ atmosphere). Each landing also validates or improves engineering techniques. For instance, the Ingenuity helicopter, delivered by Perseverance, made the first powered flight on another planet – a bonus made possible by a precise rover landing. The accumulated experience from Mars EDL successes is feeding forward into future missions. NASA’s upcoming **Sample Retrieval Lander** (part of Mars Sample Return) is designed to double the delivered mass (~2,000+ kg, nearly twice Perseverance's mass) and land within 60 meters of a target, leveraging beefed-up parachutes, more fuel for powered descent, and improved navigation. In short, the “good” is that we can land on Mars with the right technology, and each success builds confidence and know-how for bigger objectives – including human landings.

## Challenges
Mars is infamous among engineers for being just hospitable enough to demand complex landing systems, yet not forgiving enough to make any of it easy. Its atmosphere is **too thin to adequately slow down a fast-incoming spacecraft with drag alone, yet too thick to ignore**, meaning a vehicle will face intense aerothermal heating on entry. This fundamental fact makes the EDL phase on Mars especially perilous.

- **Thin Atmosphere & Speed Control:** Mars’ atmosphere is only about 1% the density of Earth’s at the surface. A lander arriving at interplanetary speeds (~5.5 km/s at entry) will experience violent heating from atmospheric friction (the heat shield endures temperatures that can vaporize metal) but still be traveling at supersonic speed when the air is no longer thick enough to slow it much further. Parachutes can deploy to provide some braking, but even the largest parachute cannot slow a heavy spacecraft to a safe landing speed in that thin air. Therefore, **rockets must usually take over while the vehicle is still traveling supersonically** – a very unstable regime for firing engines. Supersonic retropropulsion (igniting engines against the airflow > Mach 1) was long thought to be extremely risky; the rocket’s exhaust forms complex shockwaves that could destabilize or even strike the vehicle. Until recently, no Mars mission attempted to fire thrusters while supersonic – they waited until subsonic speeds, after parachute deceleration. This constraint limits landing mass, because a heavy vehicle might never get subsonic before hitting the ground. In sum, Mars forces a **“braking gap” problem**: atmospheric drag alone isn’t enough, yet firing rockets early is aerodynamically tricky.

- **Atmospheric Variability:** The density of Mars’ atmosphere isn’t constant – it varies with altitude, season, weather (like dust storms), and even local terrain height. These variations introduce uncertainty in every step of EDL. A slight difference in atmospheric density or winds can make a parachute open at the wrong speed or cause a lander to drift off-course. For instance, wind drift under parachute can add **over a kilometer of error** to the landing location. Mars also has areas of very high elevation (like the Tharsis region) where the air is so thin that **landers cannot reach those terrains** – fully half of the planet’s surface was off-limits to earlier landers due to performance limits in thin air. Precision landing is further hampered by dust: during the descent, kicking up dust can confuse radar altimeters or obscure camera views needed for navigation. In global dust storm seasons, the atmosphere’s density profile can differ significantly from predictions, a concern for timing parachute and engine events. All these factors mean a Mars lander must be designed with **wide safety margins** and often sophisticated onboard guidance to adjust to actual conditions on the fly.

- **Communication Delay & Autonomy:** A Mars-bound spacecraft, at tens of millions of kilometers away, cannot be joystick-controlled in real time. There is a radio signal delay of 4 to 20 minutes between Earth and Mars. Thus, during the critical EDL sequence (only ~7 minutes long), the vehicle **must execute all steps autonomously**, based on pre-programmed logic and its sensors. If something goes awry in those moments – a sensor error, an unexpected gust of wind, a slower deceleration than expected – there is no possibility of intervention from Earth. This need for total autonomy under deadline pressure makes EDL “closed loop” and unforgiving: the software and hardware must be exceedingly robust. It also means limited telemetry; in several failures, engineers could only guess at what happened after the fact because communication was lost during the descent. Future crewed landers might have astronauts on board who could take limited manual control, but even human pilots will be heavily dependent on automation due to the speed of events. The communications lag, coupled with Mars having periodic solar conjunction blackouts (weeks-long radio silence when the Sun blocks signals), also raises concern for **contingency aborts or rescues**. A crew that lands off-course or encounters an emergency must largely be able to rescue themselves, as help from Earth is far from immediate.

- **Terrain Hazards:** Unlike landing on a prepared pad, Mars landers hit unprepared, often rough terrain. Rocks, boulders, craters, and slopes pose serious dangers in the final moments. A large boulder can shatter a landing leg or flip a lander if touched down upon. In fact, Viking 1 in 1976 fortuitously landed just **meters away from a 1m-tall boulder** that could have caused a mission-ending crash. To mitigate this, modern missions use high-resolution orbital maps to target relatively flat, safe areas and now employ **Terrain Relative Navigation (TRN)** which allows the craft to compare what it sees (during descent) to onboard maps and adjust course away from known hazards. Still, hazard avoidance has its limits – some rocks or slopes smaller than the orbital image resolution (currently ~25 cm/pixel) might only be discovered when the lander is very close. The **touchdown dynamics** are also risky: if a lander comes in with even a slight horizontal velocity or on a slope, it could tip or tumble. Vehicles must be engineered to handle certain tilts and to land with low velocity. This challenge grows with heavier landers (including human-rated vehicles), which will have higher momentum and potentially less forgiving landing gear. Therefore, achieving a “safe and soft” landing is a complex dance of choosing the right site and precisely controlling final speed and angle.

- **Dust and Plume Effects:** When using rocket thrusters to land, the exhaust plumes striking the ground can **erode the surface and kick up debris** – a phenomenon called **Plume-Surface Interaction (PSI)**. The blown sand and rocks can sandblast the lander or nearby equipment. NASA’s Surveyor landers on the Moon experienced this on a smaller scale, but Mars’ atmosphere means the debris can be carried farther in some cases. For future Mars missions where multiple vehicles might land near a base or pre-deployed assets, engineers are very concerned about a landing rocket damaging what's already on the ground. Care is taken to not land too close to other assets; for example, the Sample Return Lander will aim to touch down a few hundred meters from Perseverance to avoid sandblasting the rover with its descent engines. Moreover, on Mars the dust kicked up can coat solar panels or lenses. The potential “rocket plume ruckus” complicates the idea of rapid, successive landings needed for a human outpost – it suggests landing pads or berms might eventually be needed to shield equipment. Until then, mission planners must treat each powered landing as a careful one-time event, with nothing fragile nearby.

In summary, the “bad” of Mars landings are the myriad of technical challenges that must be overcome simultaneously: extreme entry speeds with insufficient atmospheric braking, unpredictable winds and density, no real-time control, hazardous terrain, and environmental effects like dust. Even with successful techniques proven in ~1-ton rover landings, **scaling up to heavier cargo or crew landers (20+ tons) pushes current technology past its limits**, requiring new solutions. Each of these concerns must be addressed to ensure safe landings; otherwise, the risks compound quickly, as history has often shown.

## Solutions
To overcome the challenges of Mars EDL, space agencies and companies are developing improved technologies. This section surveys the “tech stacks” for Mars landing – from the heritage systems used so far to cutting-edge approaches – with a preference toward Elon Musk’s SpaceX architecture, while considering all major options.

- **Parachutes and Drag Devices:** Virtually every Mars lander so far has relied on a parachute to slow from supersonic to subsonic speeds in the thin air. Mars parachutes are huge – **NASA’s latest disk-gap-band chute is 21.5 meters in diameter** for the Perseverance rover, and an even larger 24 m chute is in development for the Sample Return Lander. Even so, parachutes alone can’t land a heavy craft safely; they serve to reduce velocity enough for other systems to kick in. One limitation is they are **not steerable** – once deployed, wind can push a vehicle off target by a significant distance. Future innovations in drag devices include **deployable or inflatable decelerators**: for example, NASA’s 2022 **LOFTID** test demonstrated a 6-meter inflatable aeroshell that could one day be scaled up to 10-20 m for Mars entry. These “hypersonic inflatable aerodynamic decelerators” (HIADs) act like giant brake pads, creating extra drag in the upper atmosphere to slow a spacecraft sooner and gentler, while also reducing peak heating. Six companies are currently working on inflatable decelerator prototypes under NASA contracts. Such systems could enable landing much larger masses by alleviating the “thin air” problem – essentially using sheer surface area instead of just mass for deceleration. It’s conceivable that a future human lander might use a combination of a huge deployable aeroshell and a parachute, or even multiple parachutes staged at different altitudes. However, packing and deploying such large devices reliably is a challenge (NASA’s early tests of supersonic parachutes saw several failures due to chute tearing). This remains an active area of development.

- **Supersonic Retropropulsion (Powered Descent):** All successful Mars landings to date used rocket propulsion in the final phase (for soft touchdown), but crucially they did so at _subsonic_ speeds (after parachute deceleration). **SpaceX, however, has pioneered firing rockets _while still supersonic_** – a technique absolutely necessary for very heavy landers that parachutes can’t slow enough. In fact, NASA identified supersonic retropropulsion (SRP) as _the key enabling technology_ for future human-scale Mars EDL. SpaceX unwittingly provided a breakthrough when it started recovering Falcon 9 boosters on Earth. As noted by JPL’s chief engineer Rob Manning, **Falcon 9’s return profile includes firing engines against the atmosphere at supersonic speeds in Earth’s upper atmosphere – similar to conditions at Mars**. NASA was able to observe SpaceX’s data, and to everyone’s surprise, the physics turned out more benign than feared: the engine plumes formed a shock “bubble” that actually shielded the vehicle from unstable airflow and even reduced heating. This gave engineers confidence that SRP can work on Mars. Going forward, we will see **more Mars landers using propulsive descent and perhaps skipping parachutes entirely for heavy payloads**. The Sample Retrieval Lander in development will use a propulsive terminal descent (no sky crane this time, it will throttle its engines all the way to the ground on legs). SpaceX’s planned **Starship** landers (discussed below) intend to use fully propulsive EDL, leveraging multiple throttleable engines to decelerate from supersonic speeds down to landing. SRP is complex and “very hard to analyze” computationally, so the first actual Mars demonstrations will be nerve-wracking. But most experts agree it is _the_ path to landing payloads of tens of tons, which parachutes cannot handle. In summary, retropropulsion – especially supersonic – is transforming Mars landing tech, shifting from passive drag-only systems to actively controlled powered descent. This comes with concerns about fuel (more fuel must be carried to perform the burn) and plume effects (as mentioned, blowing debris), but appears unavoidable for future missions.

- **Advanced Guidance and Navigation:** Modern Mars landers carry significantly more sophisticated guidance, navigation, and control (GN&C) systems than earlier ones. **Inertial measurement units** combined with star trackers and Doppler radar altimeters were traditional tools to estimate position and velocity during EDL. Newer landers like Perseverance added a **Terrain Relative Navigation (TRN)** camera system: during descent, the computer matches surface images to an onboard map to know exactly where it is and divert to a safe landing zone if needed. The Sample Return Lander will double-down on TRN for even tighter precision. Another innovation is the **“Range Trigger”** used on Mars 2020, which dynamically decided when to deploy the parachute based on the spacecraft’s actual position and velocity, rather than a fixed timer, thus shrinking the landing ellipse by ~50%. Future human landers will likely integrate these systems and more, possibly including **Lidar or radar-based hazard detectors** that can scan the landing zone for rocks in real time and shift the touchdown point slightly to avoid them. Guidance algorithms are also being upgraded to handle the switch from atmospheric guidance to powered descent more seamlessly (traditionally, separate phases had their own guidance logic; integrating them is a challenge). The goal for crewed missions is to achieve pinpoint landings (within tens of meters of target), which far exceeds the roughly ±1-2 km accuracy of early missions. This is why improved GN&C is such a focus – especially when multiple cargo vessels and a crew might all need to land close together on Mars, precision is paramount.

- **Surface Systems for Landing:** As mission planners envision a future Mars base, there are discussions about how to make landings safer _at the site_ level. One idea is deploying **landing pads** or at least clearing areas of large rocks. This could be done by robotic precursors (for instance, a robot could sinter Martian soil into a hard landing pad surface). NASA is also testing **landing vision systems** that can communicate with beacons or devices on the surface to hone in on a designated spot. In the nearer term, simply choosing landing sites with relatively flat, smooth terrain (like equatorial plains) is the primary method – though that constrains where missions can go scientifically. Another aspect is **post-landing stability**: landers need to ensure they don’t bounce or slide on touchdown. The airbag system allowed some bouncing, but for rockets, typically **legged landers** have crushable footpads or shock absorbers to absorb impact. There is a limit to how tall or heavy a lander can be and still be stable on legs without tipping; this is one reason SpaceX is considering using the Starship’s main body (no legs) and perhaps a very broad base for Moon landings – however, for Mars, Starship currently is planned to land on its tail with legs or with the engine skirt itself absorbing landing loads. Designing robust landing gear that can handle Mars’ uneven ground is an ongoing engineering concern, especially for crewed vehicles that will be much heavier than any past lander.

## Research
Mars has earned its reputation as a spacecraft graveyard. Prior to the 21st century, the majority of Mars landing attempts failed, and even in recent decades a number of high-profile missions have crashed or gone silent. Examining these failures provides insight into “what can go wrong” – often a combination of the challenges above and sometimes simple human error.

### Historical Mars Landing Failures
The Soviet Union’s first attempts in the early 1970s set a sobering tone. **Mars 2** (1971) became an uncontrolled meteor when its descent system failed, making it the first human-made object to impact Mars (a failure). Its twin **Mars 3** (1971) did achieve the first soft landing on Mars – a remarkable feat – but transmitted data for only ~20 seconds before falling silent, likely due to either a massive dust storm or hardware failure; thus Mars 3 was only a **partial success**. In 1974, **Mars 6** transmitted some data during descent but then crashed, and **Mars 7** missed the planet entirely due to a guidance error. After the twin successes of Viking 1 and 2 in 1976, there was a long gap. NASA’s **Mars Polar Lander** (1999) was an infamous failure – its engines likely shut off prematurely (due to a spurious sensor reading of touchdown when it was still high above the surface), causing it to free-fall to destruction. Likewise, Europe’s **Beagle 2** lander (2003) was deployed successfully to Mars but never communicated; it was later photographed on the surface partly unfolded – it **landed intact but its solar panels failed to fully deploy**, preventing it from phoning home. In 2016, ESA’s **Schiaparelli EDM** lander experienced a software failure during descent – its inertial sensor data went out-of-range, causing the computer to think it had already landed and cut the parachute/engines too early; it fell from about 4 km up and was destroyed. These “ugly” outcomes underscore how even one miscalculated parameter or sensor glitch can doom an entire mission during Mars EDL.

### Failure Rate and Causes
Overall, fewer than half of all Mars landing attempts before 2020 succeeded. Many failures trace back to the challenges outlined in the previous section. Parachutes have torn or deployed at the wrong time, retrorockets have cut off too soon or not fired at all, and navigation systems have been confused by unexpected conditions. In several cases (Mars 3, Beagle 2), the lander _did_ reach the ground but could not function – reminding us that **landing isn’t truly successful unless the spacecraft can operate afterward**. Mars 3’s premature silence and Beagle 2’s failed deployment highlight an often overlooked risk: even a soft landing can fail if your spacecraft isn’t designed to handle every contingency (dust in mechanisms, higher impact than expected, etc.). The litany of past failures is a humbling reminder that Mars tolerates no mistakes. Each crash taught lessons: for example, after Mars Polar Lander, NASA enhanced verifications of landing software and added redundancy to avoid single-point failures like the faulty sensor. After Schiaparelli, ESA upgraded its guidance algorithms for future attempts.

### Worst-Case Scenarios for Crewed Landings
So far, all “ugly” Mars landings have at least been unmanned – we lost hardware and maybe some pride, but not lives. The stakes for human landings will be orders of magnitude higher. A **crew fatality on Mars arrival** would be a worst-case scenario that could derail human exploration for years. Unfortunately, many failure modes that result in a crash would likely be non-survivable for a crew. A parachute or engine malfunction could mean a spacecraft hitting Mars at hundreds of m/s, which is unsurvivable. Even a smaller error, like landing at too high a speed or on a large rock, could tip over or collapse a crew lander. Unlike on the Moon during Apollo (where astronauts had some ability to hover or abort landing if the site looked bad, and could theoretically jettison ascent stages), on Mars an abort-to-orbit during final descent is not considered feasible with current designs. This means once a crewed Mars lander begins entry, the crew _must_ ride it out to either a safe landing or a crash – there is no in-between. Therefore, immense effort will go into minimizing the chances of failure: multiple redundant systems, robust landing engines and legs, extensive testing of software, and likely one or more uncrewed test landings on Mars before people risk the journey. Another “ugly” scenario would be landing far off course from any habitat or return vehicle. A precision error of even a few kilometers could leave a crew stranded from their pre-supplied lifeline (until they somehow traverse the distance). NASA planners intend to avoid this by requiring very tight landing accuracy (on the order of tens of meters) for human missions, and by possibly having crews land _together with_ their living habitat and return rocket on the same vehicle to eliminate dependency on separate landings.

In short, the ugly truth is that Mars landing failures have been common and often caused by seemingly small errors, and for future human missions the margin for error will be even smaller. Every past failure has prompted new engineering solutions, but the possibility of a catastrophic crash can never be entirely eliminated. The best we can do is learn from the ugly outcomes and design systems so robust that even unlikely glitches won’t lead to tragedy.

### SpaceX’s Approach: Elon Musk’s Tech Stack for Mars Landings

_An illustration of SpaceX's Starship entering Mars' atmosphere and decelerating aerodynamically (concept art by SpaceX)._

SpaceX, led by Elon Musk, has made Mars colonization a central goal and is developing a fully integrated Mars transportation system. At the heart of this is **Starship**, a next-generation reusable spacecraft designed to carry large payloads (100+ tons) or dozens of passengers to Mars. SpaceX’s tech stack for Mars landing differs from traditional NASA approaches in several key ways:

- **Fully Propulsive EDL with Starship:** Musk’s plan is for Starship to perform a **direct entry and propulsive landing** on Mars without parachutes. Starship will enter the Martian atmosphere belly-first, using its broad side (50 m long stainless steel body with heat shield tiles) as a lifting surface to aerodynamically slow down and spread out the heating – a maneuver akin to a **“belly flop”**. As it nears the ground, Starship will execute a dramatic **flip maneuver** to point its engines downward and then fire its Raptor engines to decelerate and land upright. This approach leverages **supersonic retropropulsion**, which SpaceX has validated in principle through Falcon 9 booster returns and high-altitude Starship flight tests on Earth. The big advantage is that Starship can, in theory, land very heavy cargoes that no parachute could handle, and do so with precision (guided by onboard computers and many small adjustments from its flaps and multiple engines). The challenges, however, are significant: Starship is enormous (about 50 m tall, 9 m in diameter) and will be by far the heaviest object ever attempted to land on Mars. Firing its 3 or more Raptor engines near the surface could excavate a large crater or throw debris widely, which SpaceX may need to mitigate (e.g., by selecting a very flat, empty landing zone for initial missions). Additionally, the thin air means Starship must start its engine burn relatively low or else it risks not having enough thrust to slow down in time – giving a narrow window for a successful landing burn. Musk’s team has been testing the flip and landing maneuver in Earth gravity and thicker atmosphere; prototypes like **Starship SN10** (in 2021) managed to land (albeit it then exploded due to a post-landing fire) and **SN15** successfully landed and shut down safely. These tests increase confidence, but doing it on Mars (with 0.38 Earth gravity and 1% atmospheric density) will involve different aerodynamics and engine performance. SpaceX will likely gather data from uncrewed Starship cargo landings first to fine-tune this approach.

- **Refueling and Reusability:** A crucial element of SpaceX’s Mars architecture is orbital refueling. Because a single Starship cannot carry enough fuel to launch from Earth and land on Mars with a heavy payload, SpaceX plans to **refuel Starship in Earth orbit** using tanker Starships before departure. This enables delivering a larger mass to Mars and reserving propellant for the propulsive landing and return trip. After landing on Mars, a Starship is intended to produce new propellant _in situ_ (on Mars) for the return, by leveraging Martian resources (the Sabatier reaction: combining atmospheric CO₂ with water ice to produce methane and oxygen). While in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) will happen _after_ landing (and is itself a complex task), it factors into the vehicle design. The reusability goal means Starships are built robustly enough to survive entry and landing and fly again. This is a departure from past Mars landers, which were one-off vehicles. If SpaceX can land, refuel, and relaunch a Starship from Mars, it dramatically lowers the cost per mission and risk for follow-up flights. However, each of these steps (rendezvous refueling in orbit, autonomous Mars ISRU propellant production, relaunch from Mars) is unprecedented, adding layers of risk beyond the landing itself.

- **Large Payload Capacity and Infrastructure Delivery:** Starship’s tech stack is geared toward delivering _massive_ payloads – far more than any NASA mission has contemplated. A single Starship could potentially bring ~100 tons to Mars (if refueled in orbit), including habitats, rovers, life support equipment, and people. This capacity allows a very different mission profile from, say, NASA’s plan of multiple small flights. For instance, Musk envisions sending **multiple Starships at each favorable launch window** (which occurs every 26 months) – some uncrewed cargo ships first, then crewed ones – to rapidly build up a base (often referred to as _Mars City_ concept). The tech stack therefore isn’t just the lander; it’s an entire system involving the **Super Heavy** booster (to launch Starship from Earth), **Raptor engines** (methane-fueled, high-thrust engines efficient in vacuum and suitable for Mars’ environment), heat shield tiles (SpaceX’s unique reusable ceramic tile system to survive reentry heating), and life support systems for crew. The preference for methane/LOX fuel (Raptor engines) is itself part of the strategy – methane can be manufactured on Mars from local resources, unlike the solid or hypergolic propellants used by earlier landers. By aligning the vehicle’s fuel with ISRU potential, SpaceX’s stack is optimized for a future where Mars missions become somewhat sustainable.

- **Timeline and Testing Philosophy:** Elon Musk is known for aggressive timelines. As of 2024, he stated that the **first uncrewed Starship could attempt a Mars landing as early as the 2026 window**, with a crewed mission perhaps in 2028/2029 if tests go well. In September 2024, Musk said: _“The first Starships to Mars will launch in 2 years... These will be uncrewed to test the reliability of landing intact on Mars. If those landings go well, then the first crewed flights to Mars will be in 4 years.”_. This indicates SpaceX’s intent to do iterative, real-world testing: send cargo ships, confirm they can land safely (the big EDL test), and only then risk human lives. It’s worth noting Musk’s timelines often slip – earlier he projected an uncrewed Mars mission in 2022 which did not happen, and later shifted the human landing expectation to 2029. Regardless of exact dates, SpaceX’s development approach is to build fast and test often. The Starship program has already gone through a rapid series of prototypes. Explosive failures during Earth testing (e.g., SN8, SN9 high-altitude crash landings) are treated as learning opportunities. This Silicon Valley-esque approach marks a contrast to NASA’s extremely conservative, simulation-heavy methodology. The “move fast and break things” mantra, however, will be tempered when it comes to actual Mars landings – since an opportunity to retry comes only every two years and each vehicle lost is a major setback. Still, the existence of a fully reusable system means SpaceX can afford many test flights on Earth and perhaps even some sacrificial test entries at Mars to perfect the technique.

In summary, SpaceX’s Mars landing tech stack (Starship, Super Heavy, Raptor engines, refueling, etc.) is audacious but grounded in a clear vision: _land a large, fully reusable spaceship on Mars and reuse it to ferry people and cargo repeatedly_. The approach embraces supersonic retropropulsion and heavy automation. If successful, it will dramatically reduce the cost per ton of delivering payloads to Mars, enabling not just flags-and-footprints but sustained presence. The risks, of course, are high: Starship must perform a sequence of complex events flawlessly, and doing so the first few times without incident is not guaranteed. NASA experts acknowledge Starship and similar large landers are likely the way forward for human-scale missions, but as Rob Manning quipped, “we’re all kind of chicken” about being the first to try SRP on Mars. SpaceX seems willing to be first, and the world is watching.

### Other Approaches and Future Missions (NASA, International, and Commercial)
While SpaceX captures headlines, other space agencies and companies are also pursuing Mars landing capabilities, each with their own technologies and mission plans. All options must contend with the same physics, but the strategies vary:

- **NASA’s Evolving Architecture:** NASA has vast experience with robotic landers and is now charting a path toward crewed missions in the 2030s. In the near term, NASA’s focus is on the **Mars Sample Return (MSR)** campaign. The MSR **Sample Retrieval Lander** (planned late 2020s) will be the largest craft NASA has ever landed on Mars (~2.4 metric tons). As noted earlier, it will use a combination of a large parachute and a propulsive descent with advanced navigation to achieve a pinpoint landing near Perseverance’s location. Notably, NASA chose to _not_ use the sky crane for this heavier lander, instead going with a more direct propulsive landing on legs, indicating a shift toward the kind of powered descent needed for even bigger vehicles. Looking further ahead to human missions, NASA has outlined various **Design Reference Missions** that involve sending multiple elements to Mars: typically a habitat module, a descent/ascent vehicle, and possibly a surface rover, all launched separately and pre-deployed before a crew launches. For example, one concept is to deliver a **Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV)** and surface habitat robotically, then land astronauts near them in a crew lander. This approach would likely use something like an oversized sky crane or a staged descent vehicle. However, NASA officials have recognized that a human-class lander (on the order of 20–30 tons) exceeds current EDL capability by a large margin. Thus, NASA has multiple technology development threads: inflatable decelerators (HIADs as mentioned), supersonic retropropulsion (studied in partnership with SpaceX data), and precision landing systems. There is even consideration of performing **Mars EDL test flights** at Earth (for instance, dropping large test articles from high-altitude balloons or suborbital rockets to simulate Martian conditions). NASA’s timeline for a crewed Mars landing is not officially set, but the agency’s Moon-to-Mars strategy suggests _late 2030s_ could be plausible, after establishing capabilities via the Artemis lunar program. In 2021, NASA was tentatively aiming for the mid-2030s for a crew on Mars, which aligns with statements that “sometime in the 2030s” is the goal. The exact method – whether leveraging a SpaceX Starship or developing a NASA-specific lander – is to be determined. NASA is also likely to **internationalize** a human Mars mission, as it did with the International Space Station; partnerships with Europe, Japan, Canada, etc. could provide various components and share the cost and risk.

- **China’s Ambitions:** In recent years, **China** has rapidly advanced its Mars exploration program. They achieved a **successful Mars landing on the first try** with Tianwen-1’s Zhurong rover in 2021, using a heritage approach (parachute plus retrorocket lander) similar to Viking/Phoenix. Building on that, China has announced an ambitious roadmap for Mars: a **Mars sample return mission by 2030**, and notably, a plan for a **crewed Mars mission in 2033** with follow-up human missions in 2035, 2037, 2041, etc.. According to Chinese plans disclosed by the head of their main rocket institute, the long-term goal is a permanently inhabited Mars base by the 2040s. The crewed mission architecture is still speculative, but initial steps will involve sending robotic missions to scout locations and possibly begin resource extraction (e.g. oxygen from the atmosphere, water from ice) before humans arrive. China’s approach might parallel NASA’s multi-launch strategy, but they also mention developing **nuclear-powered propulsion** to shorten travel time to Mars, which indicates they are examining every aspect of the mission. For EDL specifically, if aiming for a 2033 crew landing, China would need to master >20-ton deliveries within a decade – a tall order. It’s likely they will attempt incremental advances: perhaps a larger robotic lander or a Mars sample return using a heavier descent stage (the sample-return mission Tianwen-3 in late 2020s might involve a ~~. Additionally, China’s robust lunar program (including lunar sample return and upcoming crewed Moon landings) will feed into their Mars EDL capabilities. Watching how China tackles the Mars landing challenge will be extremely interesting; they may leverage some different technologies or brute-force a solution with very large rockets (the planned Long March 9 super-heavy launcher could send big payloads). International observers see a potential “Mars race” in the making: if China shoots for 2033 and the U.S. aims for 2030s as well, we could witness parallel efforts to land humans on Mars around the same timeframe.

- **Other International Efforts:** Other space agencies are not currently planning independent crewed Mars landings, but many are contributing to the precursor missions. The European Space Agency (ESA), aside from its ill-fated Schiaparelli test, has the ExoMars **Rosalind Franklin rover** in development (targeting a 2028 launch after delays). ESA is likely to partner with NASA for landing that rover (since the original Russian lander for it became unavailable). This indicates Europe is developing its own EDL technologies (like advanced parachutes – ESA had a program to test a 35-m diameter parachute for ExoMars). **Russia** had a string of Mars mission failures historically and, as of the mid-2020s, has no active Mars lander program (their collaboration on ExoMars ended). **India** has expressed interest in a Mars lander, and a proposed Indian Mars mission in 2030s might include a small lander and even a tiny aircraft, but details are nascent. **Japan** is focusing on a Martian Moons mission (MMX) to Phobos in the late 2020s and is not pursuing Mars landing at the moment. **United Arab Emirates** (UAE) and **others** have Mars orbiters but no lander plans yet. However, we should not count out smaller players and private ventures: for example, **Relativity Space** (a U.S. rocket startup) and **Impulse Space** announced a plan to attempt a private Mars landing mission as early as **2026**, using a relatively small lander to demonstrate commercial Mars delivery. If that proceeds, it could open the door to more low-cost attempts (as hinted by scientists like Zachary Putnam – sending _lots of smaller landers_ to Mars could be a way to take more risks and learn faster). In essence, while NASA and SpaceX and China are going after big missions, there is also an emerging ecosystem of smaller Mars mission concepts.

- **Human Mars Mission Concepts:** Beyond SpaceX’s Starship-centric plan and China/NASA, there have been numerous concepts from the community (e.g., **Mars Direct** by Dr. Robert Zubrin, which inspired some of SpaceX’s approach to ISRU and direct return, or concepts like a **Mars Semi-Direct** where some assets are pre-sent). One common theme is **pre-positioning**: sending supplies, return fuel, and infrastructure ahead of the crew so that the dangerous landing can be done first with no lives on board, verifying everything works, then the crew comes to a prepared environment. NASA’s current thinking aligns with this – send an unmanned habitat/return vehicle first, likely one or two Mars opportunities before the crewed flight. The crew might even travel in a relatively small capsule and only use the pre-sent Mars ascent vehicle to go back. However, SpaceX’s integrated approach (crew and cargo together on Starship) challenges this traditional split – if Starship is sufficiently reliable, one big ship could carry both crew and their immediate habitat. **Safety considerations** might still lead to a hybrid: e.g., maybe SpaceX lands a couple of cargo Starships as habitat and supplies, and then a crew Starship lands nearby once everything is confirmed operational. For NASA, even if they don’t use Starship for the initial human landing, they may use derivatives of the lunar lander being developed for Artemis or design a Mars-specific lander (potentially single-use). These would almost certainly involve a **two-stage design** (descent stage + ascent stage) like the Apollo lunar module, to leave some mass behind and make lifting off Mars easier. That in turn means the descent stage has to handle landing a possibly tall, top-heavy stack – a tricky proposition. This illustrates how every architecture has trade-offs: Starship’s single-stage-to/from-surface is bold but avoids needing separate ascent vehicle, whereas a NASA-style two-stage lander might be safer for abort options but more complex to land. We are still in the design phase for these missions, but the next decade (2025–2035) will likely see prototypes and tests that solidify how we finally put humans on Mars.

## Integration
Landing on Mars remains one of the riskiest endeavors in space exploration – a high-wire act on a distant world, with no safety net. We have explored the good (successful landings and the growing toolkit of technologies), the bad (the inherent difficulties and things that can go wrong), and the ugly (the history of crashes and the specter of potential disasters, especially with human lives on the line). The story so far is one of _hard-earned progress_: from early failures came lessons that led to the triumphant landings of Spirit, Opportunity, Curiosity, Perseverance, and others. Each success has been a **stepping stone** toward the ultimate goal of sending humans to Mars.

As of 2025, **all current tech stacks** for Mars landing are being pushed to their limits. Traditional methods using parachutes and small retrorockets have maxed out at about one ton payloads. New methods – supersonic retropropulsion, inflatable decelerators, precision landing sensors – are in late testing and early use, aiming to raise the payload ceiling by an order of magnitude. Elon Musk’s SpaceX is pressing forward with a fully propulsive, reusable approach via Starship, betting on breakthroughs in rocket reusability and large-scale refueling to make Mars trips routine. NASA, China, and others are likewise investing in next-generation EDL tech, from mega-parachutes to guided engines, to ensure they can land ever larger vehicles with pinpoint accuracy.

The **risks of landing on Mars** will never be zero. But they are being steadily reduced as engineering know-how increases. In the next 10-20 years, we will likely witness unprecedented events: the first private Mars landing attempts, sample returns, and finally the first footprints on Mars. A successful human landing will represent “the good” on a historic scale – the payoff of decades of innovation. Yet, this mission will carry enormous risk: every bit of “the bad and the ugly” we’ve discussed must be accounted for. The thin air, tricky winds, delayed comms, and unforgiving terrain will challenge human missions just as they did robotic ones, only the margin for error will be slimmer. The first crews will entrust their lives to the reliability of systems that are being tested rigorously right now.

In closing, Mars will continue to test our ingenuity. A famous adage in aerospace is _“Mars is hard”_ – and that remains true. But with careful preparation, smart use of new technology, and yes, a bit of luck, the prospect of a successful Mars landing (and even a thriving outpost after many landings) is within sight. The journey from the early crash landers to a future “Outpost Arcadia” on Mars has been a story of overcoming risks. By understanding those risks in detail – the good, the bad, and the ugly – we better equip ourselves to conquer the Red Planet safely and sustainably in the years ahead.

_Table Notes:_ All successful landings to date have been **robotic**. No human (crewed) landing has yet been attempted on Mars. The table illustrates the evolution from simple retrorocket landers (1970s) to airbags (1990s) to the sky crane (2010s). It also shows the mix of successes vs failures across different agencies. Notably, all successes through 2021 involved NASA or CNSA; attempts by the Soviet Union/Russia and ESA had no fully successful lander (Soviet Mars 3 was a partial, and China succeeded on its first attempt in 2021). Each method had limits: airbag systems could not handle heavier payloads, leading NASA to switch to propulsive skycranes. The next big step will likely be **fully propulsive landings for much larger vehicles**.
