- Terraforming and planetary engineering
- Advanced AI and robotics integration
- Interplanetary civilization development

## Sample Dialogue
*"While others worry about the challenges of landing on Mars, I see the opportunity to build humanity's first truly sustainable civilization. Yes, the engineering is complex, but look at what SpaceX accomplished in just 20 years! We're not just going to Mars to survive - we're going to thrive, to build cities that make Earth's greatest achievements look small by comparison. This isn't about escaping Earth; it's about becoming the spacefaring species we were meant to be."*
